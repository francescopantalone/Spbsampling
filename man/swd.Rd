\title{Sum Within Distance (Spatially Balanced Sampling Design)}
\usage{
swd(dis, n, beta = 10, nrepl = 1L, niter = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{dis}{A distance matrix NxN that specifies how far all the pairs
of units in the population are.}

\item{n}{Sample size.}

\item{beta}{Parameter \eqn{\beta} for the algorithm. The higher
\eqn{\beta} is, the more the sample is going to be spread.}

\item{nrepl}{Number of samples to draw (default = 1).}

\item{niter}{Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm. More iterations are
better but require more time. Usually 10 is very efficient (default = 10).}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{s}, a matrix \code{nrepl} x \code{n}, which contains the
\code{nrepl} selected samples, each of them stored in a row. In particular,
the i-th row contains all labels of units selected in the i-th sample.
\item \code{iterations}, number of iterations run by the algorithm.
}
}
\description{
Selects spatially balanced samples through the use of the
Sum Within Distance design (SWD). To have a constant inclusion
probabilities \eqn{\pi_{i}=n/N}, where \eqn{n} is sample size and
\eqn{N} is population size, the distance matrix has to be standardized with
function \code{\link{stsum}}.

\examples{
# Example 1
# Draw 1 sample of dimension 15 without constant inclusion probabilities
dis <- as.matrix(dist(cbind(income_emilia$x_coord, income_emilia$y_coord))) # distance matrix
s <- swd(dis = dis, n = 15)$s  # drawn sample
\donttest{
# Example 2
# Draw 1 sample of dimension 15 with constant inclusion probabilities
# equal to n/N, with N = population size
dis <- as.matrix(dist(cbind(income_emilia$x_coord,income_emilia$y_coord))) # distance matrix
con <- rep(1, nrow(dis)) # vector of constraints
stand_dist <- stsum(mat = dis, con = con) # standardized matrix
s <- swd(dis = stand_dist$mat, n = 15)$s  # drawn sample

# Example 3
# Draw 2 samples of dimension 15 with constant inclusion probabilities
# equal to n/N, with N = population size and an increased level of spread, i.e. beta = 20
dis <- as.matrix(dist(cbind(income_emilia$x_coord,income_emilia$y_coord))) # distance matrix
con <- rep(1, nrow(dis)) # vector of constraints
stand_dist <- stsum(mat = dis, con = con) # standardized matrix
s <- swd(dis = stand_dist$mat, n = 15, beta = 20, nrepl = 2)$s  # drawn samples
